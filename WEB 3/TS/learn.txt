    -> Today I have learn ts.config file what is ts config and how it is work
    we make small changes like root dir or version of the ts and other like 
    compile file path that all we can changes using ts config file

    -> Also that file contain so much content like paths,modules and many more
        (rootDir: './src')
        (outerDir: './dist')

    -> Also we change implicentlyAny or not while we change this ts can not showes 
    error to us like we have function and function contains some parameter and 
    that parameter have any type like string, interger or any
        (noImplicitAny: false)

    -> Also we can remove comments like comments is contains by ts file than in tsconfig
    we can change removeComments:true;
